# Nliteme

Nliteme (aka New Lite Test Management Engine) is an SQL database/PHP backend and Web GUI front-end based test management application optimized for collecting and presenting test execution results from automated regression test systems. It provides an easy RESTful API for uploading the data, allowing an integration “as is” with existing test systems and feeding data in almost no time as well as for an automated querying, searching, and filtering the uploaded data.

The Web GUI front-end allows the user to quickly browse, search, compare the test results from different SW releases and provides efficient filtering option to quickly spot the problems in the tested SW and/or HW.

The configurable dashboard provides a quick overview of the latest testing activities, the HighLevelReport view provides a detailed summary of the test results from different test lines and SW release and BuildCompare view, which can be useful for project management and planning.

Nliteme is a platform independent application and can be deployed on Unix, Linux, Mac Os X and Windows systems.
